Implement another method in the `PersonController` which will offer advice based on the name passed in. This method will first
find a person by name, then use a POGO (Plain Old Groovy Object) called `AgeAdvisor`  for logging "friendly" advice.

[source, groovy]
.grails-app/controllers/example/grails/PersonController.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/controllers/example/grails/PersonController.groovy[tag=personControllerOfferAdvice]
----

The POGO is simple and uses `@Slf4j` groovy annotation to establish the logger.

[source, groovy]
.src/main/groovy/example/grails/AgeAdvisor.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/src/main/groovy/example/grails/AgeAdvisor.groovy[]

<1> Note the `@Slf4j` annotation - This needed for POGOs, as only Grails artefacts have loggers injected by the Grails Framework.
